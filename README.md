## What is this?

  This repository contains general purpose programs, scripts, whatever you call them, for FTC robots.

  It was created as a repository which can quickly be cloned, configured, and ran on a bot.

  It can also be used as a learning tool as comments have been placed throughout the code explaining purposes and functionalities.

  > Writing code is opinionated. Our coding practices may not be in agreeance to yours. So, you can modify the existing code to your liking.

## How to use?

  Like the original [FTCRobotController](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) repository, the method to pushing code onto the REV Control Hub is identical.

  > This repository assumes you are using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and a [REV Control Hub](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1595/). Any deviations from these options (such as [OnBot Java](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/programming_resources/onbot_java/OnBot-Java-Tutorial.html)) is untested territory.
